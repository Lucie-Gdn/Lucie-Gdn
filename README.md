### Hi there 👋

I'm Lucie, welcome to my Github profile 🌻 <br>
At the beginning of this year I decided to become a developper, browse my profile to see my progress ! <br>
I love to start new projects in groups or on my own. I take a special care in the design of my projects, I am always eager to learn more and discover new methods of work 👩‍💻 <br>
